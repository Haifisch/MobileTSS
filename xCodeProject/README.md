MobileTSS
=========

Mobile TSS utility; Search blobs by ECID, List all firmwares being signed, List device blobs for current device

NOTE: This doesn't do much (if anything) yet. Its in EARLY DEVELOPMENT

TODO
====
- Get (current) device ECID
- ~~Get the lookup feature to communicate with Cydia/iFaith TSS servers~~ 
- Get the "This Device" feature to communicate with Cydia/iFaith TSS servers
- ~~Implement search functionality~~
- ~~Fetch and list all current signed firmwares~~

Probably much more to be done.
